# Baby Ball Bounce (2D Game in Java)

Baby Ball Bounce is a simple yet fun 2D game developed in Java as a training project, written on Eclipse IDE. The objective of the game is to prevent a bouncing ball from reaching the bottom of the screen.

## Project Structure

The main game logic is contained within the `BabyBall` class. This includes the physics of the bouncing ball and the game mechanics. A `JFrame` is used to create the window, and a `JPanel` is used for the game content.

## How to Play

On launching the game, a ball is created and placed at a random position on the screen. The ball starts to move in a direction determined by a random initial velocity. The player must use the mouse to click the ball and prevent it from reaching the bottom of the screen. If the ball reaches the bottom, the game ends.
